Microsoft Access Database Project    Total Points (20)
Create a Microsoft Access database that models a corporate environment with employees, projects and departments.
You must have at least these three entities but you may create more if it is warranted.

The entities are related as follows:


An employee can only work in one department.
A department can have many employees

A project belongs to one department
A department can have many projects

For each table add at least three rows and use made-up sensible data.


Part of the assignment is to determine which attributes should be used for each table along with the appropriate 
data types. Look at the following queries that will help you determine what attributes to create.
Also, create other attributes that would make sense in this corporate environment.



The following queries need to be created and saved with following format: Q1Employees working project. The next query 
would be saved as Q2Hours on project by employee. This way the queries will be ordered from Q1 to Q5:

Q1) List all of the employees.
Q2) Find a particular employee by name
Q3) List the departments that have budgets greater than $50,000
Q4) List the projects ordered by Start Date
Q5) List all projects that are no longer active.



After you create the database zip your file along with the police quiz and send in via Courseweb.
Do not e-mail your file. Do not print out your file. Do not slip it under my door:)
